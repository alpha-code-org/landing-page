# Build Your Company Brand with PostPilot

Branding is the single most important asset that makes difference between successful and unsuccessful
companies. Before you continue reading, please be aware that there is no magic formula or shortcut to
establish trust between you and your customers. Just like any other social interaction, you need to
present yourself as someone who is disciplined, hard-working and most importantly, <b>keeps promises</b>!
There are no **guarantees** in business, but if you put a lot of focused time, effort and creativity into it,
you increase your chances of being noticed. With that out of the way, there is one tool that can help you
achieve your business goals more efficient.

Sometimes you get an idea about interesting content that resonates with a lot of your followers, or you
want to promote your business accomplishments, but you can feel that it is not the best time to publish.
Problem for me was that I am not patient enough to wait for that perfect moment for my post to go viral.
Both of these key branding issues and many others are solved when I started using PostPilot, social media
post publishing application for LinkedIn and X.
