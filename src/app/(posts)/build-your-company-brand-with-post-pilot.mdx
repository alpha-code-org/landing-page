# Build Your Company Brand with PostPilot

<BlogHeader author="Mateo GaliÄ‡" />

Branding is the single most important asset that makes difference between successful and unsuccessful
companies. Before you continue reading, please be aware that there is no magic formula or shortcut to
establish trust between you and your customers. Just like any other social interaction, you need to
present yourself as someone who is disciplined, hard-working and most importantly, <b>keeps promises</b>!
There are no **guarantees** in business, but if you put a lot of focused time, effort and creativity into it,
you increase your chances of being noticed. With that out of the way, there is one tool that can help you
achieve your business goals more efficient.

Sometimes you get an idea about interesting content that resonates with a lot of your followers, or you
want to promote your business accomplishments, but you can feel that it is not the best time to publish.
Problem for me was that I am not patient enough to wait for that perfect moment for my post to go viral.
Both of these key branding issues and many others are solved when I started using PostPilot, social media
post publishing application for LinkedIn and X.

## Quick overview of PostPilot

PostPilot is built with most modern tech stack, allowing you to express your ideas blazingly fast, without
wasting time on slow page loads. It comes with <b>Free tier</b> for freelancers like myself, to help them in
reaching out to their clients and customers with ease.

Dashboard presents all key actions you will be able to perform when wanting to create new post.
First thing that you need to do is to connect your LinkedIn or X account with platform. After that you
will be able to create new post by clicking <i>Schedule Post</i> button. On the right sidebar you can quickly
navigate to:

- _Posts_ - Preview all of your active posts that are ready to be published or have already been published
- _Billing_ - Upgrade your plan to have even more control over your post scheduling
- _Draft_ - Showcase all drafted posts which are still marked as "work in progress"
- _Templates_ - Create post templates which can be embeded into posts like signatures into emails

## Templates

Let's create a catchy phrase or brand slogan which is going to be in the footer of every post we publish.
This will be the thing our brand is going to be recognized for. <i>Title</i> field is just for organization
purposes and it would not be included in post content.

Notice something really cool, if you provide a valid link, it will show in preview mode for both
LinkedIn and X if no other media like image is provided ðŸ”¥
