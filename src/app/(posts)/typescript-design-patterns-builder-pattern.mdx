# Typescript Design Patterns: Builder Pattern

<BlogHeader author="Mateo Galić" />

Have you ever encountered a problem with displaying <Highlight>item price</Highlight> inside React components?
Price calculation logic tends to be full of conditions and constraints. Some view layers show price with <Highlight>tax</Highlight>,
some with <Highlight>discount</Highlight> and some with both! There is also a need to format currency based on users preferred language.

This logic can be expressed by using functional style where <Highlight>applyTax function</Highlight> wraps initial price,
then <Highlight>applyDiscount function</Highlight> wraps that result and finally <Highlight>formatPrice function</Highlight> applies proper currency display.

```ts
const finalPrice = formatCurrency(
  applyDiscount(applyTax(initialPrice, buyer), discountPercentage),
  language,
);
```

On our team, we found that Builder Pattern is easier to understand because of the chaining of methods.
It is more aligned to how we as humans think. Other than that, it's a nice way to encapsulate important business logic.

```ts
const finalPrice = new PriceBuilder(initalPrice)
  .applyTax(buyer)
  .applyDiscount(discountPercentage)
  .formatCurrency(language)
  .build();
```
