# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that allows developers to build static and dynamic websites efficiently. It provides built-in features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.

In this article, we'll cover some key features of Next.js and how to get started with it.

## Key Features of Next.js

Next.js offers a range of features that make it a go-to framework for modern web development:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: With SSR, pages are pre-rendered on the server on every request, providing fast loading times and improved SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: You can generate static pages at build time, making the content load instantly.
- **API Routes**: Easily create server-side API endpoints using the `pages/api` directory.
- **Image Optimization**: Built-in image optimization with automatic resizing and lazy loading.

## Installing Next.js

To get started with Next.js, you'll first need to set it up in your project. Follow these steps to create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
cd my-nextjs-app
npm run dev
```
