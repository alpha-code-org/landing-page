# Next.js Infinite Loader with Server Components

React Server Components have changed the way we think about rendering process in React.
Instead of focusing on one environment at a time, components can render on the server and the client simultaneously.

This can be problematic when it comes to infinite loading, because server components don't have access to the state.
For example, if we have a cursor pagination mechanism for data fetching, we need to keep track of the previously loaded pages on
the client. Easiest way would be to store fetched data in the state and every time user reaches the end of the list,
trigger new request with updated cursor and update state with fresh awaited data.

I would definetely recommend using library like React-Query for this task, because it has built-in support for infinite loaders.
You can still prefetch data in server components and seed query cache with initial data, which gives instant feedback to the user.
